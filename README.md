# urimeterproject

The arduino code is aimed to control a hardware system made of 2 solenoid valves, a non-contact liquid level switch and a screen as electronic components. Every time the sensor detects liquid, means that a certain quantity of liquid (urine) has been reached and the valve should open. The times the valve opens are computed in a time window of 30 minutes and results are updated to Matlab. The Matlab interface program is aimed to calculate and control the patients' diuresis and help the health professional.
